Kevin,
 
Minimum Release Checklist (MRC).  This is a release checklist that must be reviewed by General 
Manager (GM) and Customer Support Manager (CSM). 
 
GM delegated MRC approval to PMMs or Product Owners.
 
CSM (was Dile) delegates MRC approval to Quality Assurance (QA).   If QA approves release, CSM 
automatically approves MRC.
 
Do you approve as CSM or temporary CSM?
 
Marie

Kevin,
 
CSM delegates MRC approval to QA.  If QA approves release, CSM automatically approves MRC.
 
Do you approve?
